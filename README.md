### Aim of the Project
To educate children how electricity is generated from natural sources such as wind, solar power and a water turbine.


### Project Description
This project was desined in **Unity3d** and is targeted platform is a Windows PC app _(It can be ported to other OS by changing the build-settings)_. The project has 3 simulations of **_water turbine_**, **_solar panel_** and a **_wind turbine_**. Each of these simulations can be explored in any order to learn more about how they functions in the real world. The simulation allows the player to explore the scene via the _arrow keys_ and certain interactions requires clicking using mouse buttons. The interactions are displayed on the screen as user interacts with different parts of simulations as described above.


### 1. Water Turbine/Dam
The Water turbine shows various information about dams in the United States and allows the user to interact with the turbine to observe generated power. 

This is how the Dam looks like the app:

User is given instructions on how to navigate around the simulations as shown here:

The Water turbine simulation provides various information such as how power is calculated, how much power this dam generates, and how big the dam is. The user gets a chance to change the flow, turn the dam on and off, and find the information about the dam based on states by selecting it from a drop down menu, as shown the below:

### 2. Solar Panel
This simulations aims to explain how solar energy gets converted into electrical energy. The image below describes how the solar panel looks like in the simulation:

The instructions on how to navigate the simulation are displayed on screen such as below:

This simulation also explains different parts and devices needed to generate, store and transfer electricity via the panel. This simulation uses  **Restful API** provdided by **[NREL](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/) (national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy)** which shows the real time statistics regarding how much energry is being produced in USA using photovoltaic cell and how many units of installations are currently working accross United States. An example is shown below:

_**Photovoltaic**_ refers to the process of turning the energy of the Sun directly into electrical current through the use of photovoltaic cells. Photovoltaic technology is relatively new; as a viable energy source, it is less than _50 years old_. However, it has great potential for the future. As a source of energy, sunlight is free, its supplies are unlimited and it is available in the majority of areas of the world.



### 3. Wind Turbine
This simulation explains the various parts that constitute a Wind Turbine and allows the user to interact with various parameters of a wind turbine size and see the correspondinding effect on electrcity generated. The wind turbine is shown below:
